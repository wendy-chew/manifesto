        <p> The United Nations is one of the pivotal perspectives when defining the challenges of human rights and how they should be handled.  The Guidance Notes to Data Collection and Disaggregation is a document created to help uphold human rights, and itâ€™s technical frame of reference is ideal for the Right to Privacy manifesto.  Privacy is one of six principles the Guidance Notes focuses on, the other five being Participation, Data disaggregation, Self-identification, Transparency, and Accountability.  This document provides a coherent and intelligible set of directives that have the prestige of the UN, and are feasible to execute. </p>
