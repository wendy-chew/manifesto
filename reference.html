            <li>These situations require the software engineer to use ethical judgment to act in a manner which is most consistent with the spirit of the Code of Ethics and Professional Practice, given the circumstances.</li>
            <li>The dynamic and demanding context of software engineering requires a code that is adaptable and relevant to new situations as they occur...The Code helps to define those actions that are ethically improper to request of a software engineer or teams of software engineers.</li>
            <li>Software engineers shall act consistently with the public interest. In particular, software engineers shall, as appropriate: 
                <ul>
                    <li>1.03. Approve software only if they have a well-founded belief that it is safe, meets specifications, passes appropriate tests, and does not diminish quality of life, diminish privacy or harm the environment. The ultimate effect of the work should be to the public good.</li>
                    <li>1.04. Disclose to appropriate persons or authorities any actual or potential danger to the user, the public, or the environment, that they reasonably believe to be associated with software or related documents.</li>
                    <li>3.12. Work to develop software and related documents that respect the privacy of those who will be affected by that software.</li>
                    <li>3.13. Be careful to use only accurate data derived by ethical and lawful means, and use it only in ways properly authorized.</li>
                    <li>3.14. Maintain the integrity of data, being sensitive to outdated or flawed occurrences.</li>
                    <li>6.06. Obey all laws governing their work, unless, in exceptional circumstances, such compliance is inconsistent with the public interest.</li>
