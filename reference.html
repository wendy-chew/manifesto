                <span class="tab"></span>There's a lot to be said about policy making, especially internally within companies and externally when developing your own projects. The Code of Ethics is very clear on this discussion, and makes many points when considering developing a project. The points we would like to draw attention to are listed above, shortened to make the reading easy but we’d recommend reading the entire document, as the Code of Ethics was not made to be taken out of context and used to further anyone’s individual claims.

                <span class="tab"></span>We wanted to focus on their requirements about company policy, privacy and how Software developers have a duty to think and respect those who use their projects. Software developers have a duty to not diminish the quality of life, respect the privacy of users, use only properly authorized data, and consider how they’re using said data in the public’s interest. All of these requirements in the Code of Ethics directly mirror our own goals in this manifesto, furthering our reasoning that there should be more transparency and understanding between users interacting with tech and those who develop and pay for it.

But now it’s effectively run by a series of unelected bodies from ICANN, the non-profit organization that supervises internet addresses, to the internet service providers that set data speeds and prices; and from the self-appointed stewards of Wikipedia to the search engines and social networks that determine what we see and what we don’t. We can still speak with liberty, but our authority depends a great deal on how well we game these systems.

                <span class="tab"></span>Barlow’s declaration failed to acknowledge that the government would quickly learn the tricks of the online world and turn them to its own ends. It failed to foresee that some of the biggest threats to liberty would come not from government but from the very libertarians and tech pioneers who wanted to get away from government in the first place. And it peddled the impossibly idealistic hope that physical space and cyberspace could stay both distinct and radically different, despite having the same people living in both.

                <span class="tab"></span>The internet still needs its Barlows. There is much to rage about: overweening,copyright protection, government snooping, censorship, encryption backdoors, assaults on net neutrality, the unaccountable power of tech giants. But the new activists navigate a more complex terrain of pragmatism and compromise. Gone for good is any notion that cyberspace can ward off these threats by remaining somehow pure and sovereign.
