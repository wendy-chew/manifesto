        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <div class="description">
        <p class="indent"><span class="tab"></span>Right to Privacy. It’s been a highly debated topic throughout the last few centuries, but there has been a different twist to the narrative for the last thirty years. </p>
        <p class="indent"><span class="tab"></span>As technology has advanced, so much so that it’s now readily available in every household in most developed countries, so has that anxiety. In recent years, there have been more corporations and companies who have been effectively misusing, selling, and collecting  people’s data, without their knowledge and most times, without their explicit consent.  </p>    
        <p class="indent"><span class="tab"></span>This change has come with the expansion of mobile devices and the ability for corporations to place stricter limits on access, and increased oversight that has also been introduced by the prevalence of smartphones. In the first few years of the internet, the possibilities seemed to be endless, but as more knowledge has come to light about personalized data collection, people become more concerned about their data- where it is going, who is using it and why they are using it.  There are few regulations on how data is collected and used, which has led to rampant misuse and, at times, has been a direct violation of personal privacy.</p>
        <p class="indent"><span class="tab"></span>There have been several manifestos and ethics codes provided in the past (see reference page), however we’ve seen the corporations such as Amazon, Google, Facebook, blatantly ignore, violate and desecrate these values. However, there’s also the issue of the ever changing nature of technology we need to consider as well. In the case of A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace by John Barlow, the manifesto was written over twenty years ago. It outlines sentiments similar to our own manifesto but the ‘internet’ that Barlow was familiar with has changed significantly in the last thirty years. With these new principles and goals, we’re hoping to expand on his ideas and be able to extend his, and many others influences to the modern era.</p>
        <p class="indent"><span class="tab"></span>With our Principles, we hope to secure a right to privacy, a right to live without our data being constantly tracked, analyzed and sold to third parties. Companies and Corporations need to become more transparent in what data they are taking from people who use their products and services and how they are using people's data. </p>

        <h2>Principles: </h2>
        <div class="description">
        <div class="indent">
            <ul>
                <li>Data collectors should provide clear, openly accessible information about their operations, including research design and data collection methodology.</li>
                <li>Ensuring user privacy and confidentiality must be considered alongside ease of access to information.</li>
                <li>Information that identifies individuals or discloses an individual’s personal characteristics should not be made public as a result of data dissemination.</li>
                <li>Data collectors must have robust data protection mechanisms and procedures.</li>
                <li>There should be a clear understanding between those who are taking the data and those who are using it. Those who are providing the data should have the right to have a say in how their data is being provisioned.</li>
                <li>When personal data is released, this should only be done with the permission of the individual concerned or their appropriate representatives.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>


        <h2>Goal:</h2>
        <div class="description">
        <div class="indent">
            <ul>
                <li>Create a better understanding about how your data, identity, and life are being used by third parties. </li>
                <li>Change the means by which people have been able to access their own personal information (ie, in the past they have not been able / allowed to access their own personal data).</li>
                <li>The right to deny access to personal information, and the right to have data already collected erased</li>
                <li>In this world of constantly changing technologies, we should update these requirements as we go. Tech now is not the same as it was 20 years ago, and will probably not be the same when 2040 comes around. We need to adapt these policies to these changes and understand that privacy is a right that each person should enjoy.</li>
            </ul>
