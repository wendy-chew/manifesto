    <title>Manifesto | The Right to Privacy</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Introduction:</h1>
    <p>Right to Privacy. Why is this an issue? In recent times, we’ve seen a lot of people become more concerned about their data- where it is going, who is using it and why they are using it. As technology has advanced, so much so that it’s now readily available in every household in most developed countries, so has anxiety. </p>


    <h2>Goal:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Create a better understanding about how your data, identity, and life are being used by third parties. </li>
        <li>Change the means by which people have been able to access their own personal information (ie, in the past they have not been able / allowed to access their own personal data).</li>
        <li>The right to deny access to personal information, and the right to have data already collected erased</li>
        <li>In this world of constantly changing technologies, we should update these requirements as we go. Tech now is not the same as it was 20 years ago, and will probably not be the same when 2040 comes around. We need to adapt these policies to these changes and understand that privacy is a right that each person should enjoy.</li>
