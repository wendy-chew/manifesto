        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Right to Privacy. Why is this an issue? In recent times, we’ve seen a lot of people become more concerned about their data- where it is going, who is using it and why they are using it. As technology has advanced, so much so that it’s now readily available in every household in most developed countries, so has anxiety. </p>

        
    
    <h2>Principles: </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Data collectors should provide clear, openly accessible information about their operations, including research design and data collection methodology.
        </li>
        <li>Privacy and confidentiality must be considered alongside access to information.</li>
        <li>Information that identifies individuals or discloses an individual’s personal characteristics should not be made public as a result of data dissemination.</li>
        <li>Data collectors must have robust data protection mechanisms and procedures</li>
        <li>There should be a clear understanding between those who are taking the data and those who are using it. Those who are providing the data should have the right to have a say in how their data is being provisioned.</li>
        <li>When personal data is released, this should only be done with the permission of the individual concerned or their appropriate representatives.</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Goal:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Create a better understanding about how your data, identity, and life are being used by third parties. </li>
        <li>Change the means by which people have been able to access their own personal information (ie, in the past they have not been able / allowed to access their own personal data).</li>
        <li>The right to deny access to personal information, and the right to have data already collected erased</li>
        <li>In this world of constantly changing technologies, we should update these requirements as we go. Tech now is not the same as it was 20 years ago, and will probably not be the same when 2040 comes around. We need to adapt these policies to these changes and understand that privacy is a right that each person should enjoy.</li>
    </ul>
